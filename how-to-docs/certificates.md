### **Application Certificates**
-----
Before reading about certificates and how you can create and manage them. [Please familiarise yourself with our DNS naming convention first](../docs/dns.md)

The platform provides two ways of managing [HTTPS certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS):
- [Internal based certificates](#internal-certificates) i.e. `hostname.namespace.svc.cluster.local` using CFSSL
- [External based certificates](#external-certificates) for external services i.e. `service.homeoffice.gov.uk` using kube-cert-manager and letsencrypt

In most systems, it's likely that your service will have a user facing service, that will be served through an external endpoint i.e. it can be routed to externally by users as well as having non-external facing services i.e. internal services.

You would want all communication between the user, through to the service and service dependencies to be encrypted, so that the traffic flow has encryption and that all endpoints trust who they are speaking to.

###Â Internal Certificates

If your service is not external facing i.e. there is no external routing to your application,  then you will want an internal certificates for  services that want encryption of traffic between one another, but with an internal trusted CA. This means that serviceA can talk to serviceB securely and trust the authority that has issued the certificates for both of those services. We use CFSSL to sign the CSR's and have tools that you will place with your deployment, that will enable the creation and storage of the certificate for your webserver or application.


#### **CA Bundle**

By default, in the all namespaces a CA bundle has been added which can been mounted into the /etc/ssl/certs of the container and which contains the root CA used to verify authenticity of the certificates. An example of using it is given below.

### External Certificates

If your service has an application that has to be routed to externally i.e. users or other services will need to connect into your application that isn't hosted locally in the platform; then you will want to offer TLS to encrypt the traffic flow.

`kube-cert-manager` and `ingress` are services that will enable automated fetching and load balancing of your service dynamically, based on the information you provide.

**Note** That there are restrictions around the DNS name you can use on your namespace to prevent using domains the project is not authorative for.


#### **Deployment Examples**

Although technically the certificates aren't exclusively for ingress, the following show's a common deployment of external service via [ingress](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/application-container-platform/blob/master/how-to-docs/ingress.md) with backend services / pods using tls between ingress controller and themselves.

First we have to acquire the certficate from the CA.

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment

  name: example
spec:
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:

      - name: certs
        # PLEASE do not use latest, but check for the latest tag in the releases page of https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/cfssl-sidekick
        image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/cfssl-sidekick:latest
        securityContext:
          runAsNonRoot: true
        args:
        - --certs=/certs
        - --domain=myservice.${KUBE_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local
        - --domain=another_domain_name
        - --expiry=8760h
        env:
        - name: KUBE_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        volumeMounts:
        # an emptyDir which the sidekicks writes the certificates
        - name: certs
          mountPath: /certs
        # The platform CA Bundle hold the root ca used to verify the certificate chain
        - name: bundle
          mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs
          readOnly: true
      - name: your_application
        image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/some_image
        ...
        ports:
        - name: https
          port: 443
          targetPort: 443
        volumeMounts:
        # You can configure your application to pick up the certificates from here (tls.pem and tls-key.pem)
        - name: certs
          mountPath: /certs
          readOnly: true
      # Ensure you mount the volumes
      volumes:
      - name: bundle
        configMap:
          name: bundle
      - name: certs
        emptyDir: {}
```

The cfssl sidekick will request the certificates and place into the /certs directory which is shared between app and itself. Note, the ```--expiry`` can be used to configure the rotation of the certificates, although it's presently up to the application to reload them.


Next we deploy the service.

```shell
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myservice
  labels:
    name: myservice
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 443
  selector:
    name: myservice
```

We then connect the services together, tying up the ingress and backend services.

```shell
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress
  annotations:
    # this tells the ingress to use tls between itself and service
    ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: "true"
    # this selects the external ingress - internet facing
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx-external"
  labels:
    # this asks for a certificate from letsencrypt
    stable.k8s.psg.io/kcm.class: default
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - hostname.example.gov.uk
    secretName: tls
  rules:
  - host: hostname.example.gov.uk
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: myservicename
          servicePort: 443
```

Adding the network policy. Note, by default we place a default deny into everyone namespace, blocking all traffics between pods. The following adds a network policy permitting the ingress to speak to the pods.

```shell
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: permit-traffic
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: ingress-external
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
```

**HTTP Challenge**

The above example requires that the DNS zone of the ingress hostname you are adding is located in the AWS account that kube-cert-manager resides, i.e. it has the ability to update records on your behalf. Assuming this is not the case you will need to use a HTTP challenge rather than the default DNS one. You will need to change your DNS hostname to a CNAME of ingress-external / ingress-internal ENVIRONMENT.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk i.e assuming notprod environment mysite.domain.com -> ingress-external.notprod.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk

#### **Note: if you are placing your ingress behind the VPN i.e. using the ingress-class `ingress-internal`, the HTTP challenge will not work, please contact the ACP team as you will need to move or delegate your domain to Route53**


```shell
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress
  annotations:
    # this tells the ingress to use tls between itself and service
    ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: "true"
    # this selects the external ingress - internet facing
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx-external"
    # change the provider to http
    stable.k8s.psg.io/kcm.provider: http
  labels:
    # this asks for a certificate from letsencrypt
    stable.k8s.psg.io/kcm.class: default
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - hostname.example.gov.uk
    secretName: hostname_tls
  rules:
  - host: hostname.example.gov.uk
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: myservicename
          servicePort: 443
```

**LetsEncrypt Limits**

Note Letsencrypt while a free service does come with a number of service limits detailed [here](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/). Probably one of the most crucial for projects is the max certificate requests per week; currently standing at 20. In addition, there is a max 5 failures for per hostname with a freeze of 1 hour, so if you accidently mess up configuration you might hit this.
